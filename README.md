# Shade Influence on *Hemileia vastatrix*
Analysis of Hemileia vastatrix, coffee leaf rust, in shaded coffee systems. An independent study analyzed several sites, including polyculture and monoculture farms. Investigated the influences of the spread of coffee leaf rust in Costa Rica, Monteverde province.

## Objectives
- Determine if there is a correlation between shade levels and *Hemileia vastatrix* infection severity.
- Evaluate whether foliage age is associated with infection levels.
- Compare disease outcomes in monoculture vs. polyculture systems.

## Methods
- ANOVA comparing shade levels and infection rates
- Poisson regression model on foliage age vs. infection count
- Data collected from coffee plots in Costa Rica

## Key Results
- Significant correlation between shade and disease suppression
- Younger foliage is more affected by infection

## Tools
- R, ggplot2, dplyr
